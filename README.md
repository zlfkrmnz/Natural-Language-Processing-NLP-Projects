# My NLP Projects Repository

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to projects in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, you'll find a collection of my work ranging from academic experiments to practical applications, all aimed at exploring the vast capabilities and recent advancements in NLP.
Repository Overview:

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my NLP endeavors. It includes:

    Academic Projects: Assignments, case studies, and research projects from my coursework or self-driven studies.
    Application Development: Real-world applications and solutions employing NLP techniques to solve business or social problems.
    Experimentation and Analysis: Experimental projects where I test different NLP algorithms, models, and preprocessing techniques.
    Tutorials and Guides: Documentation and guides I've written to explain complex NLP concepts or to demonstrate the use of NLP tools.

## Technologies:

In these projects, I leverage popular NLP frameworks and libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, TensorFlow, and PyTorch among others, to preprocess text, extract insights, and build predictive models.
